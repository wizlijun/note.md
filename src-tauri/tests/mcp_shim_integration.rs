//! End-to-end test for `notemd mcp` — the stdio shell (`mcp::shim::run_shim`)
//! reached through the *real* CLI routing (`cli::router` → `cli::builtin` →
//! `mcp::shim::run_shim`), driven over an actual stdin/stdout pipe to the
//! built binary.
//!
//! This exists because every other test around this feature stops short of
//! the shell itself: `router.rs`'s tests only check routing (never call
//! `run_shim`), and `dispatch.rs`'s tests call `dispatch::handle` directly,
//! bypassing the shell's stdin loop entirely. The one property that
//! `shim.rs` exists to deliver — `initialize`/`tools/list` answer from the
//! compiled-in static schema so the tool list survives a closed GUI, while
//! only `tools/call` needs IPC — had no regression coverage: an edit that
//! accidentally routed `tools/list` through `forward()` would have passed
//! `cargo test` and broken every agent whose note.md happens to be closed at
//! session start.
//!
//! Follows the binary-spawning + HOME-isolation pattern established in
//! `cli_builtin_integration.rs`; unix-only for the same reason that file is
//! (see its header — `dirs::config_dir()`/`data_dir()` on Windows ignore an
//! overridden `%APPDATA%` in the child environment, so isolation there needs
//! a different mechanism this test doesn't have).

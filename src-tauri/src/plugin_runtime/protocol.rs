///    whitelists it or asks the user to approve it. So it does NOT stop a
///    malicious plugin — one that simply writes `"editor.kit"` into its
///    manifest walks through. What it does buy: an ordinary plugin has no such
///    surface by default, and the declaration is a durable, auditable line in a
///    manifest the marketplace can review. Against a plugin that *has* declared
///    it, the real limits are steps 2–4 plus the standing premise that `dist/`
///    holds no secrets. The gate runs FIRST so an undeclared plugin gets a
///    byte-identical 404 for every `__host__` URL — well-formed or not — and
///    cannot infer the reserved prefix exists by diffing status codes.
/// 2. **Segment validation → 403.** Empty, `.` and `..` segments are rejected.
///    This matters beyond tidiness: in dev builds `AssetResolver` resolves
///    against the `frontendDist` *directory* and `PathBuf::components()` keeps
///    `ParentDir`, so an unchecked `..` really would read outside `dist/`.
///    Percent-escapes are refused here rather than decoded: `get_asset`
///    percent-decodes again downstream (`manager/mod.rs`), and declining to
///    decode at all means this boundary never depends on reasoning about how
///    many decode passes each side performs. No bundled asset name needs an
///    escape, so the ban costs nothing.
/// 3. **Directory confinement → 404.** Only [`HOST_ASSET_DIR`] is mirrored;
///    the dist root's HTML entry points are structurally out of reach. 404
///    rather than 403, to stay consistent with step 1's silence.

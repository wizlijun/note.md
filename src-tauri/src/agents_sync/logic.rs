pub const SEARCH_SECTION: &str = r#"## Searching this vault

This vault has a local full-text index. Prefer it over a raw `rg` sweep: it is
faster, it knows Chinese word boundaries, and it ranks the notes you have
actually annotated above machine-generated summaries of them.

```
notemd search <query...>            # path:line:text, ranked, exit 1 = no match
notemd search "exact phrase"        # phrase match
notemd search x tag:y type:z        # filters: tag: type: path: ext: after: before: page:[[X]] origin:
notemd search origin:human          # only what a human wrote/signed (vs derived|source|unlabeled)
notemd search origin:unlabeled      # files with no frontmatter and no source-glob match — fix these
notemd search x --json              # adds score, breadcrumb, source_ref, provenance, origin, attention_minutes
notemd search x --context 2         # surrounding lines
notemd search x --all               # every hit — default cap is 20 (--limit N adjusts, 0 = no cap)
```

`rg` and `grep` keep working and are never wrong to use — the index is an
accelerator, not a gatekeeper. When a result's `provenance.agent_by` is set, the
text was written by a model: follow its `sources` to the primary document before
relying on it. `origin` classifies a whole file into `human` (you wrote or
signed it) / `derived` (a model generated it) / `source` (raw material a model
still has to read) / `unlabeled` (nobody has claimed it — no frontmatter, no
source-glob match) — filter to `origin:human` to see only what a human
actually judged, or `origin:unlabeled` to find files worth labeling one way or
the other, or read the field in `--json` output to weigh a hit accordingly.
Unlabeled files are ranked lowest by default (×0.3) and can fall out of the
top results entirely, so `origin:unlabeled` is the way to find them anyway.

### If you can't run `notemd` yourself

Some harnesses can call tools but can't reach a binary on this machine. note.md
serves the same index over MCP for those — register it once, in the client's
own config, and `search` / `vault_info` show up as tools:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "notemd": { "command": "notemd", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

`search` takes only `query`, `limit` (0 = no cap) and `context`. The filters go
inside the query string, exactly as above — one grammar, whether you type it in
a shell or pass it as a tool argument. Hits carry the same fields `--json` does,
so everything above about `origin` and `provenance.agent_by` applies unchanged.

Two fields exist only on this surface, and both are worth reading before you
trust a path:

- **`vault_info.index_state`** — `ready` means answers are real. `opening` means
  wait a few seconds and ask again. `failed` or `idle` means the index isn't
  serving; that is when falling back to `rg` is the right move, not a defeat.
- **`mount.status`** — whether the paths you get back mean anything *to you*.
  `matched`: a folder you have mounted is this vault, so open hits directly.
  `mismatched`: it isn't. Use the returned `text` and `breadcrumb`; resolving
  `/dailynote/2026/x.note.md` against your own mount would open a different file
  that happens to share the name. `unknown`: the client didn't say what it has
  mounted — compare `<your mount>/.notemd/vault-id` against the response's
  `vault_id` before you resolve anything.

A `truncated: true` response means the byte budget cut the list short, not that
the vault holds no more. Narrow the query and ask again.

Calling `vault_info` once at the start of a session costs nothing and is the
cheapest way to learn all of the above. This surface is read-only: it can find
things and tell you where they are, but it will never write to the vault.

 * direction fixes that, since the clip happens before the menu ever reaches the
 * window edge.
 *
 * Preference order, and why:
 *  - **Below, right-aligned.** The button is right-of-centre in every surface
 *    that uses it, and reading down from what you clicked is the default habit.
 *  - **Flip up** when there is not enough room below and more room above — a
 *    row near the bottom of a long ebook queue is the common case.
 *  - **Flip to left-aligned** when right-aligning would push it off the left
 *    edge, which happens in the narrow sidecar panel.
 *  - **Clamp** as the last resort, so a menu taller than the viewport still
 *    has its top on screen rather than its middle.

// v1 -> v2: added `files.origin` (provenance tiering, spec
// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-md-origin-tiering-design.md` §3). No
// migration — see the module doc comment: the index is disposable derived
// data, so a version bump means `open` wipes and rebuilds rather than
// ALTERing an old database into shape.
//
// v2 -> v3: a fourth `origin` value (`Origin::Unlabeled`) and three new
// `files.ext` values (`srt`/`vtt`/`txt`) landed (spec
// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-source-globs-and-transcript-indexing-
// design.md`) — no column shape changed, but a v2 database's stored `origin`
// values were computed by a build that didn't know about the unlabeled tier
// or the source-glob rules that produce it, so they read as wrong under this
// build's vocabulary. Same no-migration rule as above: bump and let `open`
// wipe it. This version also retires `sync_dir` in `meta` in favor of
// `source_globs` (see `open`'s doc comment) — bumping the schema version
// means every pre-existing database gets wiped on this transition anyway, so
// there is no in-place rename to worry about.
//
// v3 -> v4: `blocks_fts` gained a third column, `tok_title`, carrying each
// file's title and filename stem on its File-level block (spec
// `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-wikipage-search-priority-design.md` §3).
// This one is a genuine *column shape* change — an FTS5 table's column count
// is fixed at creation and `bm25()`'s weight list must match it — so an old
// database cannot answer this build's queries at all. Same no-migration rule:
// bump and let `open` wipe it.
//
// v4 -> v5: `blocks_fts` became CONTENTLESS (`content=''`,
// `contentless_delete=1`). A standard FTS5 table keeps its own copy of every
// indexed column in a `%_content` shadow table; measured on a real
// 8,977-file vault that copy was 632 MB of a 1.6 GB index — 39% — and
// nothing ever read it (queries JOIN back to `blocks` for the real text; no
// `snippet()`/`highlight()` anywhere; `bm25()` works contentless). Column
// shape again, so again: bump and let `open` wipe it.
//
// v5 -> v6: a new `doc_attention` table carries per-file attention-minutes
// figures folded from the reading-insights analytics JSON on disk (see
// `attention::fold`). It has no relationship to `files`/`blocks`/`links` shape
// — no existing column changed — but it is new schema surface all the same,
// and an old database simply lacks the table a build past this point expects
// to be able to write to. Same no-migration rule as every prior bump: wipe
// and let `open` rebuild rather than `ALTER TABLE ADD` it in place.
//
// `doc_attention` deliberately carries NO explicit index. It was first created
// (T4) with `CREATE INDEX doc_attention_minutes ON doc_attention(minutes DESC)`
// to serve T8's attention candidate arm (`query::fts_arms`'s second arm,
// `ORDER BY att.minutes DESC`). Measured with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` once that
// arm existed: the index is STRUCTURALLY unreachable there and was dropped
// again in the same unreleased schema version. The arm is FTS-driven —
// `SCAN blocks_fts VIRTUAL TABLE INDEX` → `SEARCH b`/`f` by rowid → `SEARCH
// att USING INDEX sqlite_autoindex_doc_attention_1 (path=?)` — so
// `doc_attention` is the INNER table of a join keyed by `path`, and an ORDER BY
// on a column of an inner table can only be satisfied by `USE TEMP B-TREE FOR
// ORDER BY`. Switching the `LEFT JOIN` to `INNER JOIN` does not change that.
// The index was not free: `replace_attention` replaces the whole table every
// refresh (DELETE + re-INSERT), so every ingest rebuilt it in full. Removing it
// needs no further version bump — v6 has never shipped, and an index is not
// readable surface: a v6 database created by an earlier dev build keeps a stale,
// unused index, which costs a hair on write and nothing on read. That change
// alone did not warrant rebuilding; v7 below adds actual readable surface.
// If you want it back, prove with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` that a real query uses it
// first — `query::tests::no_unused_index_on_doc_attention` is the tripwire.
// v6 -> v7: explicit confidentiality metadata. Existing indexes rebuild; until
// that finishes consumers must report index-not-ready, never assume coverage.

/// stamp is resolved by emptying the tables through the connection already
/// opened (see below). There is deliberately no repair path in either case:
/// the index is disposable derived data, and rebuild is always correct while
/// repair logic never fully is.
///
/// What is **not** resolved that way is any *transient* failure — most
/// importantly `SQLITE_BUSY`/`SQLITE_LOCKED` from another process holding the
/// write transaction (a `build_full`, a flood sweep), and plain I/O errors.
/// Those are propagated to the caller, which degrades (the CLI scans files
/// directly; the GUI leaves `IndexHandle` empty and the panel says "not
/// ready"). Wiping on an opaque `Err` was a real data-loss bug: `notemd
/// search` run while the GUI rebuilt would delete `index.db`/`-wal`/`-shm`
/// out from under the live writer — silently, exit code 0 — leaving the
/// writer committing into an orphaned inode and the GUI serving a database
/// nobody else can see until the next relaunch. Deleting the `-wal`/`-shm`
/// of a live WAL connection is additionally SQLite's own documented
/// corruption hazard. See `is_corruption` and
/// `a_concurrent_writer_must_not_cause_open_to_wipe_the_database`.
///
/// Control flow is straight-line, not recursive: `try_open` is called
/// exactly once, and if it reports the file needs wiping (or fails to open
/// at all), at most one wipe and one fresh-schema creation follow — never a
/// retry loop. The wipe's *result* is verified (`wipe` reports whether the
/// file is actually gone) rather than assumed, because `remove_file` can
/// fail silently for reasons outside this process's control — most
/// realistically on Windows, where another process (the GUI or the CLI,
/// whichever isn't this one) holding the file open blocks deletion. If the
/// wipe didn't take, this returns an `Err` instead of looping or — worse —
/// silently continuing to use a database that is still stale: a stale
/// index answering queries under the wrong tokenizer is a wrong-results bug
/// dressed up as a working one, which is worse than failing loudly.
///
/// `globs_stamp` is `SourceGlobs::stamp()` for the vault's currently
/// configured source-glob patterns — stamped into `meta` (key
/// `source_globs`) and compared on every open. This is the second staleness
/// trigger of this shape this store has had, and it replaces the first:
/// `origin::derive`'s old rule 5 read the sync-mirror directory name
/// (`sync_dir`) directly, so a changed `sync_dir` could make a stored
/// `origin` wrong, and this same stamp-and-compare mechanism guarded against
/// it under the `sync_dir`/`meta.sync_dir` names. Rule 5 was retired in
/// favor of user-configured source-glob patterns (rule 5′) — `origin::derive`
/// no longer reads `sync_dir` at all — so this check was repointed at
/// `SourceGlobs::stamp()` instead of being left running against a value with
/// no remaining correctness reason to be checked (schema bump to 3, see
/// `SCHEMA_VERSION`, forces every pre-existing database through this
/// transition once). The *reason* the mechanism exists is unchanged: the
/// incremental sweep's stat/hash fast path only touches `mtime`/`size` on an
/// unchanged file, so nothing else re-derives a stored `origin` when the
/// config it was computed from changes — without stamping that config into
/// `meta` and comparing it here, a stale `origin` would survive indefinitely.
/// `search::mod::open_vault` and `cli::search::run` are the two
/// `SearchIndex::open` callers that compute this value, both as
/// `opts.source_globs.stamp()` off the same `ScanOptions` returned by
/// `search::options::for_vault` (the declared single construction point) —
/// never resolved independently, so the stamp can never drift from the
/// patterns `origin::derive` actually used for that scan.
///
/// **It is (for now) the one staleness trigger a user can flip at
/// runtime**, and that is why it is answered by rebuilding the contents *in
/// place* rather than by deleting the file (see `rebuild_in_place`, and
/// `changed_globs_rebuild_in_place`/`changed_globs_rebuild_in_place_keeps_the_inode`).
/// `schema_version` and
/// `tokenizer_id` are build-time constants — a running process cannot see
/// them change, so no live handle can exist on the other side of that
/// mismatch, and wiping stays correct there. A source-glob pattern can
/// change while the GUI holds a live WAL connection (it is a text field on
/// the settings page), so the unlink this function's own doc comment calls
/// "a real data-loss bug" would come back through a perfectly legitimate
/// stale path: `notemd search` (which `AGENTS.md` tells every agent to run
/// habitually) opening the index seconds later, seeing the old stamp, and

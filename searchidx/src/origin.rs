//! Provenance tiering for retrieval ranking (spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/
//! 2026-08-11-md-origin-tiering-design.md`, §3; rules 5 and 6 superseded by
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-source-globs-and-transcript-indexing-
//! design.md`, §3 — that document's rule table, 5′/6′, is what the code
//! below implements).
//!
//! `origin` classifies every indexed file into one of four tiers so
//! later ranking can weigh "what you wrote" above "what an agent produced"
//! above "raw material an agent has to read" above "nobody has said who
//! wrote this" (CLAUDE.md belief 1). It is **derived at index time and never
//! written back to the file** (belief 2, file-over-app) — the vault's
//! frontmatter stays exactly what its author wrote; `origin` only ever lives
//! in the index row.
//!
//! "Every indexed file", not just `.md`: since C-T4/C-T5, `chunk::parse_file`
//! also calls `derive` for `.srt`/`.vtt`/`.txt`. Those arrive with `None`
//! frontmatter by construction (they have none to parse — see the format
//! dispatch in `chunk::parse_file`), and they are only ever indexed *inside*
//! a source glob, so rule 5′ necessarily fires before rule 6′ can: a
//! transcript is always `Source`, never `Unlabeled`. Spec §3 states that as
//! an invariant; it is a consequence of the scan gate, not a rule here.
//!
//! §3's rule table is ordered and **first match wins**. The order below must
//! match the spec table exactly; each rule below carries the rationale for
//! why it sits where it does, because reordering two rules silently changes
//! real files' tiers (see the priority tests at the bottom of this file).

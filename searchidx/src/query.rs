// `row_to_hit` and the two `r.get::<_, _>(N)` calls for `rank`/`is_annotation`
// below must change with it — see the module-level hazard note in the task
// brief. THIS IS THE SHARPEST EDGE IN THIS FILE: every column here is TEXT
// or INTEGER-ish, so a shifted index resolves via a nearby column's value
// with NO type error and NO test failure unless something explicitly pins
// that column's value round-tripping through a real index (see
// `a_hits_origin_round_trips_through_the_real_index` and
// `a_hits_concept_type_round_trips_through_the_real_index` below — both
// exist specifically to catch that).
//
// `f.origin` (index 10) is deliberately last of the "stable" columns, and
// `f.concept_type` (index 11) is appended AFTER it — not inserted in the
// middle — so neither this column's position nor any earlier one moves
// again if a future column is added. `f.title` (index 12) follows the same
// rule, appended after `concept_type` rather than slotted next to the other
// `files` columns. Every caller appends its own `rank` column after
// everything here — index 15 since C-T7 widened this list (it was 13 before;
// see the C-T7 paragraph below). `is_annotation` (index 9) is unchanged from
// before `origin`/`concept_type`/`title` were added.
//
// `f.title` is read into `finish`'s row tuple, NOT into `Hit` — pinning is
// the only consumer and it has no business widening the public hit shape
// (same treatment `is_annotation` already gets).
//
// C-T7 appended two more, again AFTER everything above rather than beside
// their thematic neighbors: `COALESCE(att.minutes, 0.0)` (index 13) and
// `att.as_of` (index 14), both from the `LEFT JOIN doc_attention` each
// caller adds. They shifted every caller's own `rank` column from 13 to 15 —
// the one hardcoded index in this file that had to move with them.
//
// If you add another column here, know exactly how forgetting to move `rank`
// fails, because the obvious guess is WRONG: it does NOT raise
// `InvalidColumnType`. Index 13 is `COALESCE(att.minutes, 0.0)` — a REAL,
// same as `rank` — so a stale `r.get::<_, f64>(13)` reads back a perfectly
// valid number and every hit's bm25 is silently replaced by its attention
// minutes (0.0 for most files). `score_of` then floors that to `r = 0.001`
// for every hit, all scores collapse to one value, and relevance ordering
// stops existing — with no error, no panic, and (measured, C-T7) not one red
// test out of the whole suite INCLUDING `tests/acceptance.rs`'s
// retrievability regression set. `the_bm25_rank_column_actually_reaches_the_
// score` below was added for exactly this: it is the one test that dies when
// `rank`'s index is wrong.

// pattern on purpose: see its own comment below for why ANDing repeats there
// would silently zero out every result instead of widening the match. If you

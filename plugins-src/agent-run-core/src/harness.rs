//! What the user needs to know about the harness behind an agent, before they
//! trust a run to it: is it there, which version, which model, and did the last
//! run fail for a reason that will just happen again.
//!
//! That last part is why this is not merely `--version`. A harness whose
//! credentials expired reports its version perfectly happily and then fails
//! every run with "OAuth session expired". Version alone therefore answers the
//! wrong question — "is it installed" — while the user is asking "will it work".
//! So the status carries the last run's failure when that failure looks like an
//! environment problem rather than a task problem.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT here: an active credential probe. Verifying auth means
//! making a real model call — slow, possibly billed, on every window open. We
//! report what we observed rather than what we provoked.

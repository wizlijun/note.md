// Asserts that the Editor Kit really came out of the frontend build (spec §7).
//
// Why a build-output check and not a unit test: the failure mode is a *bundler*
// failure, invisible to any test that imports the source. It has already
// happened once — vite's app default for `preserveEntrySignatures` drops entry
// exports (HTML entries never need them), which tree-shook the whole kit down
// to a 35-byte file with its CSS side effect and nothing else. Every source
// test still passed; the kit only failed at runtime, inside a plugin webview,
// as a dynamic import that resolved to a module with no `mountMarkdownEditor`.
// A vitest case cannot see this without running a full `vite build` first, so
// the assertion is wired into `pnpm build` itself (see package.json) — that is
// also what `tauri build` runs via `beforeBuildCommand`, so no release can ship
// a broken kit.
//
// Checks, in order of what breaks in practice:
//   1. both artifacts exist under dist/assets/ with the stable, hash-free names
//      the `plugin://<id>/__host__/assets/…` URL hard-codes;
//   2. the JS is not a tree-shaken stub;
//   3. the JS actually exports `mountMarkdownEditor` (the v1 API entry point).

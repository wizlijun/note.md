# mdeditor

Minimal markdown editor for macOS. Source / rich dual mode. Tabs. Nothing else.

Built on `@moraya/core`.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

## Build

For the current Mac architecture only:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

For a universal (Intel + Apple Silicon) `.app`:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin
pnpm tauri build --target universal-apple-darwin
```

Output: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/mdeditor.app` (single-arch) or
`src-tauri/target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bundle/macos/mdeditor.app` (universal).

## Manual Smoke Test (run before each release)

1. **Launch via Finder double-click** of any `.md` file → app opens with that file in a tab
2. **Cmd+O** → file dialog → select a `.md` → opens as new tab
3. **Drag a `.md` from Finder** into the window → opens as new tab
4. **Drag onto Dock icon** while app is running → opens as new tab in same window
5. **Edit content** → tab title shows dirty dot
6. **Cmd+S** → file is saved (timestamp changes); dirty dot disappears
7. **Cmd+Shift+S** → save dialog → save to new path → tab title updates to new filename
8. **Close dirty tab (× or Cmd+W)** → confirm dialog appears (Save / Discard / Cancel via two-step prompt)
9. **Cmd+/** → toggles between source mode (textarea) and rich mode (WYSIWYG)
10. **Re-launch app** — Open Recent submenu is not yet implemented in v0.1; recent list is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/com.bruce.mdeditor/settings.json`
11. **Toggle Preferences → Enable auto-save** (Cmd+,), edit, wait 1s, verify file saved silently
12. **Open a md with KaTeX, mermaid, code block** → all render in rich mode
13. **Cmd+W to close last tab** → empty state appears (window does not close)
14. **Close window with one dirty tab → Cancel** → window stays open
